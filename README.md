# Alarm Clock - Plugin for KSP2
Create alarms that will interrupt time warp, allowing you to juggle transfer windows and other time sensitive moments in the middle of time warping for other missions. Find it in the app bar, or use Alt-A to toggle the window. Currently in a very barebones state, will be adding much more functionality. Reach out to me for suggestions, or any issues you notice!

## Installation
Download the .zip file from (Spacedock)[https://spacedock.info/mod/3533/Alarm%20Clock]

Place the .zip file into your KSP2 installation folder, and extract the contents.

## Usage
- Open the plugin window in the app bar, or toggle it with Alt + A.
- Create alarms by selecting any two planets to find the next transfer window, or set custom times (more options coming soon!)
- Time will automatically pause at each alarm.
- Saving the game will automatically save all alarms as part of the save file.
